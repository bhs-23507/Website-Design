        <h2>Ancient Ghana Empire (4th–13th Century)</h2>
        <img src="./images/ancient.jpg" alt="Ancient Ghana">
        <p>The Ghana Empire (not to be confused with modern Ghana) was one of West Africa's earliest powerful empires, existing from around the 4th century to the 13th century in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali. It became wealthy due to its control over gold and salt trade routes. However, this empire eventually declined due to invasions, internal conflicts, and the rise of the Mali Empire.</p>

            <p>In the area now known as modern Ghana, various kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries:

                <p><strong>Akan Kingdoms:</strong> The Akan people established several kingdoms, including the Ashanti Empire, which became powerful in the 17th century. The Ashanti had a highly organized society and became known for their wealth, trade (especially gold), and resistance to European colonialism.</p>

                <p><strong>Mole-Dagbani States:</strong> The Dagomba, Mamprusi, and other groups also formed influential states in northern Ghana.
                Ga-Adangbe People: The Ga people, who settled in the coastal areas, developed key trading hubs such as Accra.</p>

            The trans-Saharan and later the trans-Atlantic slave trade affected these kingdoms significantly. The Ashanti and other kingdoms participated in these trade networks, sometimes capturing enemies and selling them as slaves.</p>

        <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
        <p>Starting in the 15th century, European powers, including the Portuguese, Dutch, British, and Danes, arrived in West Africa seeking to control the lucrative gold and slave trades.

            <p><strong>Gold Coast:</strong> The British gradually established dominance in the region known as the Gold Coast by the 19th century. In 1821, the British formally declared the Gold Coast a colony, and over the next century, they expanded their control over inland territories, often clashing with the powerful Ashanti Kingdom. The British finally defeated the Ashanti in 1901, annexing their territory.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Colonial Development:</strong> During British colonial rule, the economy of the Gold Coast developed around the export of cocoa, gold, and timber. However, colonial rule was often exploitative, and local resistance movements began to emerge.</p>
